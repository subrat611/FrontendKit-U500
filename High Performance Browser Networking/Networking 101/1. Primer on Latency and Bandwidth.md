## Speed Is a Feature

**Importance of Speed in Web Performance**

- Growth of the Web Performance Optimization (WPO) industry highlights the increasing demand for faster user experiences.
- Speed influences critical aspects of online businesses:
    - Better **user engagement**.
    - Improved **user retention**.
    - Higher **conversion rates**.

**Core Components of Network Performance**

1. **Latency**:
	- Definition: The time it takes for a packet to travel from source to destination.
	- Key factor in real-time and interactive applications.
2. **Bandwidth**:
	- Definition: The maximum throughput of a logical or physical communication path.
	- Determines the capacity of data transfer over a network.

**Decreasing Latency: Real-World Example**

- **Hibernia Express (2015)**
	- A $300M+ fiber-optic project to reduce latency between New York and London.
	- Achieved **58.95 ms latency**, ~5 ms faster than previous transatlantic links.
	- **Significance**:
		- A millisecond advantage in high-frequency trading translates to $60M+ in gains.
		- Demonstrates how latency reduction is both technically and financially valuable.
- **Why Latency Matters**
	- Crucial for time-sensitive applications like financial trading, online gaming, and real-time communication.
	- Even minor latency improvements can lead to significant business and user experience benefits.
