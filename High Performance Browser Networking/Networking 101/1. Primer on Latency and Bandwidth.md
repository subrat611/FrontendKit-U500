## Speed Is a Feature

**Importance of Speed in Web Performance**

- Growth of the Web Performance Optimization (WPO) industry highlights the increasing demand for faster user experiences.
- Speed influences critical aspects of online businesses:
    - Better **user engagement**.
    - Improved **user retention**.
    - Higher **conversion rates**.

**Core Components of Network Performance**

1. **Latency**:
	- Definition: The time it takes for a packet to travel from source to destination.
	- Key factor in real-time and interactive applications.
2. **Bandwidth**:
	- Definition: The maximum throughput of a logical or physical communication path.
	- Determines the capacity of data transfer over a network.

**Decreasing Latency: Real-World Example**

- **Hibernia Express (2015)**
	- A $300M+ fiber-optic project to reduce latency between New York and London.
	- Achieved **58.95 ms latency**, ~5 ms faster than previous transatlantic links.
	- **Significance**:
		- A millisecond advantage in high-frequency trading translates to $60M+ in gains.
		- Demonstrates how latency reduction is both technically and financially valuable.
- **Why Latency Matters**
	- Crucial for time-sensitive applications like financial trading, online gaming, and real-time communication.
	- Even minor latency improvements can lead to significant business and user experience benefits.

## **Components of Latency**

1. **Propagation Delay**:
	- Time for a signal to travel from sender to receiver.
    - Dependent on **distance** and **signal propagation speed** (close to the speed of light).
2. **Transmission Delay**:
	- Time required to push all bits of a packet onto the network link.
	- Dependent on:
	    - **Packet size**.
	    - **Data rate** (e.g., 1 Mbps vs. 100 Mbps).
	- Example:
	    - Sending a 10 MB file over a 1 Mbps link takes **80 seconds** (10 MB = 80 Mb).
	    - The same file over a 100 Mbps link takes **0.8 seconds**.
3. **Processing Delay**:
	- Time required for routers to:
        - Process the packet header.
        - Check for bit-level errors.
        - Determine the outgoing route.
    - Often performed by hardware, so delays are small but non-negligible.
4. **Queuing Delay**:
	- Time a packet waits in a buffer before being processed.
    - Affected by network traffic load and router capacity.

**Key Insights on Latency**

- Longer distances increase **propagation delay**.
- More intermediate routers increase **processing** and **transmission delays**.
- Higher traffic load increases **queuing delay**.

### **Example: Bufferbloat in Your Local Router**

- **Bufferbloat**: A phenomenon where excessive buffering in routers leads to high and variable latency.
    - Routers with large incoming buffers try to avoid packet drops.
    - This disrupts **TCP's congestion avoidance mechanisms**, worsening performance.
- **Solution**:
    - The **CoDel (Controlled Delay)** algorithm was introduced to manage queue delays effectively.
    - Implemented in Linux 3.5+ kernels.
