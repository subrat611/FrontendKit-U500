> TIP: **Clarifying the problem statement**
> Don't jump into solution, ask questions to the interviewer.
>
> - Where do I get the paginated data.
> - What if the data is not present, what if the API failed.

**_Q1. Where I get the data?_**
Ans: DummyJSON

> NOTE: There are two ways of implementing pagination
>
> 1. Front-end heavy
> 2. Back-end heavy

> TIP: If you are running out of time just focus on implementing the feature not the styling. You can do it later.
