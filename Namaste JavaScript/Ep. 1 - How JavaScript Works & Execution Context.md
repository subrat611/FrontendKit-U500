## Execution Context

- Everything in JavaScript happens inside an `Execution context`.
### Components of Execution Context

1. Memory component (also called `variable environment`)
	- Where all the variables and functions are stored as key-value pair.
2. Code component (also called `thread of execution`)
	- Where all the code executed one line at a time.

> JavaScript is a `synchronous`, `single-threaded` language.

- **Single-threaded**: JavaScript can execute one command at a time. 
- **Synchronous single-threaded**: JavaScript can only execute one command at a time and in a specific order.
