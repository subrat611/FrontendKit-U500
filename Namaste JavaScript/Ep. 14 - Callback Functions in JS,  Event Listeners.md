## Callback Function in JavaScript

A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed later, usually after an operation completes.

```js
function greet(name, callback) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
  callback();
}

function sayGoodbye() {
  console.log("Goodbye!");
}

greet("Alice", sayGoodbye);
```

### Why Use Callback Functions?

- Handling Asynchronous Operations (e.g., API calls, setTimeout)
- Code Reusability & Flexibility
- Customizing Behavior

### Callback in Asynchronous Code

```js
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("This runs after 2 seconds");
}, 2000);
```

ðŸ“Œ `setTimeout` takes a **callback function** and executes it after 2 seconds.

### Callback Hell (Nested Callbacks Issue)

When callbacks are deeply nested, it makes the code hard to read and maintain.

```js
fetchData(() => {
  processData(() => {
    saveData(() => {
      console.log("All done!");
    });
  });
});
```

**Solution:** Use **Promises** or **Async/Await** instead.

## Summary

âœ… A **callback function** is a function passed as an argument to another function.  
âœ… It is commonly used for **asynchronous operations**.  
âœ… It is also used in **array methods** like `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.forEach()`.  
âœ… Too many nested callbacks lead to **callback hell**, which can be avoided with **Promises** or **Async/Await**.

## Blocking main thread

```js
setTimeout(function(){
	console.log("Timer");
}, 5000)

function x(y) {
	console.log("x");
	y();
}

x(function y(){
	console.log("y");
})
```

```js
// OUTPUT
x
y
Timer
```

JavaScript has one `call stack` and you can call this as `main thread`. Whatever is executed in the program it executed through the `call stack`. 

So If any operation block the `call stack` that is known as **`blocking the main thread`**

## Event Listeners

```js
document.getElementById("clickMe").addEventListener("click", function(){
	// this is a callback function
	// when the event occurs this function push into the call stack and execute
	
	console.log("Button Clicked"); // put a debugger here and check on call stack
})
```

**Qus:** Count the times the button clicked.

Here instead of creating a global variable it's better to create a closure.

```js
function attachEventListeners() {
	let count = 0;
	
	document.getElementById("clickMe").addEventListener("click", function(){
		// this is a callback function
		// when the event occurs this function push into the call stack and execute
		
		console.log("Button Clicked", ++count); // put a debugger here and check on call stack
	})
}
```

## Garbage Collection & Remove Event Listeners

Garbage collection (GC) is an automatic memory management process in JavaScript that removes **unreachable objects** from memory. However, improperly managed **event listeners** can cause **memory leaks** if they keep references to objects that should be garbage collected.

Even in the large code base you have seen that lot of people remove `Event Listeners` on certain events. (But why?)

- Event Listeners are heavy (i.e it takes memory). 
	- Because when you attach event listeners it forms closures. (Even the call stack is empty).
- For this the page get slower.

### Event Listeners & Memory Leaks

Event listeners **hold references** to DOM elements. If not removed properly, they prevent elements from being garbage collected, causing memory leaks.

#### Example of an Event Listener Causing a Memory Leak

```js
document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", function () {
  console.log("Button clicked!");
});
```

 If the button element is removed from the DOM (document.getElementById("btn").remove()), the event listener still holds a reference, preventing garbage collection.

#### How to Properly Remove Event Listeners?

To remove an event listener, you must pass the **same function reference** used in `addEventListener()`.

```js
function handleClick() {
  console.log("Button clicked!");
}

const btn = document.getElementById("btn");
btn.addEventListener("click", handleClick);

// Later, when we want to remove it
btn.removeEventListener("click", handleClick);
```
