## **What is JavaScript?**

- A scripting language initially created to make web pages interactive.
- Runs directly in the browser; no compilation needed.
- Independent from Java despite its name, with its own specification called **ECMAScript**.

### **Key Features**

- Executes on various environments (browser, server, devices) with a JavaScript engine.
- Examples of JavaScript engines:
    - **V8**: Used in Chrome, Opera, Edge.
    - **SpiderMonkey**: Used in Firefox.
    - **JavaScriptCore**: Used in Safari.
- Engines parse, compile, and optimize scripts for fast execution.

## **Capabilities of In-Browser JavaScript**

1. **DOM Manipulation**: Add/change HTML, styles, and content dynamically.
2. **Event Handling**: Responds to user actions like clicks, key presses, etc.
3. **Networking**: Send/receive data using AJAX or fetch.
4. **Storage**: Work with local storage and cookies.
5. **User Interaction**: Display alerts, ask questions, and handle file uploads.

## **Limitations of In-Browser JavaScript**

- No direct access to files, OS, or CPU for user safety.
- Requires explicit user permission for accessing devices (e.g., camera, microphone).
- Restricted by **Same-Origin Policy** to prevent cross-site attacks:
    - Interaction between tabs/windows is limited unless explicitly allowed.

## **What Makes JavaScript Unique?**

1. **Integration with HTML/CSS**.
2. **Ease of use for simple tasks**.
3. **Universally supported by all major browsers**.
